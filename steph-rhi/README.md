# 04-Templating

**Authors**: Rhiannon Mortensen & Stephen Harper
**Version**: 1.0.1 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
We built an application that utilized handlebars.js CDN to replace our cloning method of templating our articles. Then we converted our existing HTML template to fit the bill of our newer method of templating, then updated the .toHtml() method to render stuff via the handlebars template. Also, refactored out traditional jQuery functions and methods in our code to ES6 arrow fuhnctions when we could. 

## Getting Started
Use the resources from the OrigiREADME.md, and do their best to follow along with the starter-code instructions.

## Architecture
Languages Used :
Handlebars, jQuery, JavaScript, CSS for web page design, and HTML for the structure.
